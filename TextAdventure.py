"""
There are two primary systems to this text adventure game, the objects, and the text engine.

Every item in this game, including the player, is an "Interactable", with relevant statitistics based on the item type.
One thing in common with all interactables is that they have a container, which is objects they store.
The world is linked through several stored objects inside each other, or with links provided by door objects.

The following is a list of item types with their properties:

    Interactable (Base Class):
        This is the most basic layer of class. They, and every other item, has the following properties:
            Name: The given name of the object, which is searched when interacted with in the text engine
            Description: A description of the object when looked at. The contained items are also displayed, so that a "Chest" item will reveal the "Treasure" inside when searched.
            Contains: A list of contained items.
            UseCase: Text displayed when interacted with, if not already another item.
            TakeAble: Value determining whether object can be picked up or dropped.
            BreakAble: Value determining whether object can be broken.
            BrokenItem: Item dropped when broken. This can be used to "hide" items. For instance, a crate can drop a broken crate, which contains a sword. The broken crate and the sword will not be shown when the crate is inspected.
            BreakKey: Object needed in Player's inventory to break item. Can be any Interactable.

    Room: 
        Has stored coordinates (currently UNUSED) and is pointed to by Player objects as an area to be interacted with.
        Players can only interact with items in the same room they are in.

    Wall:
        Has a stored direction, so that when a Player "Looks Left" they are directed to the Wall in their room with the matching orientation.

    Door:
        Has a linked destination and can be locked with a defined item (currently only keys can unlock doors). 

    Key:
        Has a saved "target" to search for, assumedly a Door object. When used, if the target object is in the same room as the player, the door unlocks.

    Player:
        Has a defined room, and all actions run through Player.
        The player's "contains" serves as the inventory for purposes of picking up and dropping objects.

Nested objects can be difficult to sort through, so a helper class objectTree() was created to print out every avalible item behind a larger one.
Hidden objects are denoted with a "-" symbol behind the item
An example tree is attached, in the file worldTree.txt.
                
The text engine runs by taking user input as a string, splitting up the string into the defined noun, verb, and adjective.
Before assigning terms, each term in the input is run through an alias dictionary, converting similar words into a set of predefined words. (Changing "Steel" to "Metal")
In a perfect system, the noun points to an Interactable, which is then passed to a method in the Player object defined by the Verb.
Obviously there are edge cases where assumptions have to be made, for example the input "Look" implies the noun "Room", and other similar cases.
There are also cases where multible targets are selected, for instance, "look at wall" can imply four different walls, so the first result is defaulted to, unless an included adjective can break the tie.
For example, "Open Oak Door" reconizes "Door" as the noun, sees "Oak Door" and "Steel Door" in room, and selects "Oak Door" from a reconized "Oak" adjective.

For the purpose of debugging, the command "debug" can be run, which shows more informational data reguarding the series of events.
